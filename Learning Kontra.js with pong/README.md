# Pong
This is a simple pong game using the javascript framework Kontra.js. Since kontra.js has no option for rendering text this game also
relies on manipulating the DOM to display score.

### What to change when revisiting:
- UI
- create my own collision detection function, built in function 'Sprite.collidesWith(object)' is buggy
- Winning Screen
