# p5.js Physics API
Created on August 4th 2019.

This is a demo of a simple physics engine I wrote. You can place a wall or a floor and create a ball which can be hit and can interact 
with walls and floors. The force of gravity, the coefficient of restitution of the ball, the mass of the ball and the density of the ball
can be changed to adjust the simulation.

I will use this in future projects.

To play the demo download this directory and run the index.html file or go to [Physics API Demo (supermac30.github.io)](https://supermac30.github.io/Games/PhysicsAPIDemo/PhysicsAPIDemo.html).

## Controls
Use WASD to apply a force on the ball

## What to change when revisiting:
- make the collision function generalised so that objects do not have to be floors or walls.
- Add the ability for different balls to interact.
- Fix a bug where the ball seems to stick to the wall when moving at a fast speed.
