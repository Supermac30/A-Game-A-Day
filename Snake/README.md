# Snake
Created on july 7th 2019.

This game is a copy of the Nokia classic snake. It is currently unpolished, but it won't be forever. This is the first game in my game a day challenge.

The objective is to eat food without bumping into yourself or the wall. You grow whenever food is eaten.

To play download this directory and run the html file.
## Controls
