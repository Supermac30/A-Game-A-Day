# Checkers
This is the classic board game checkers written in the javascript framework p5.js. I used a minimax algorithm to create the AI. 

I have improved this algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, the Ai creates a search tree of depth 6, thinking 4 moves ahead (0 being the first move).

To play download this directory and run the index.html file in your browser.

## Controls
Click on the piece to move. You play as white.

## What to change when revisiting:
- Make the minimax algorithm much faster (iterative deepening)
- Be able to choose difficulty
