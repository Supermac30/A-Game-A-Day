# Breakout
This is a version of breakout written in processing.py. This version of breakout has a level editor with which levels can be made and played. 
A default mode is also playable. The darker the block the faster the ball moves when hitting it.

Was working on several games at once, from now on I will focus on one game at a time to stay on track
