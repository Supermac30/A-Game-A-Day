# MiniGolf
This is a minigolf game I built with my p5.js physics API. Every level is composed with walls and grounds. The goal is to get the ball to the 
flag in as little shots as possible.

To play this game download this directory and run the index.html file or go to https://funonabun.tk/Games/MiniGolf/MiniGolf.html
